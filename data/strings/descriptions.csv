derelict_terraformer,CUSTOM,"A starship hull which dwarfs most stations, this ancient leviathan was likely sent to terraform a nearby planet as part of some long-forgotten expansion plan. It may still contain functional terraforming equipment.",,,
planetary_accretor,SHIP,"The pinnacle of the Eridani-Utopia corporation's terraforming genius (and, some would say, hubris), the Genesis-class planetary accretion device is barely a starship - grossly expensive, ponderously slow, completely unarmed, and single-use - but it is capable of a feat previously thought impossible. It creates a planet out of an asteroid belt's raw materials.

Deployed in an asteroid field, the device unleashes intense but targeted gravitic bursts to attract mineral-rich bodies from across the system. Once the entire asteroid field is on a collision course to this central point, the Genesis shifts into phase-space and - through a poorly-understood implosion process - draws in a tremendous concentration of dark matter. This process destroys the reactor, but its work is done. As the asteroid belt coalesces into a single molten planet, the incoming dark matter absorbs its thermal energy before vanishing back into higher n-dimensional spaces, leaving a cooled surface ready for colonization. Better still, the targeted nature of the asteroid accretion ensures that this crust will be unimaginably rich in metals and contain harvestable amounts of volatiles and complex hydrocarbons.",,,
station_research_genesis,CUSTOM,A nominally abandoned research station. Scans indicate low-level activity typical of systems in standby mode.,,,
terraform_hypershunt,SHIP,"This massive vessel contains the central systems of a coronal hypershunt, most notably the hyperspace actuators which will be used to open its wormhole and the mag-field apparatus which will shield the rest of the structure during construction.

It is helpless in combat and will need a fleet to tow it into a star’s corona. Once magnetically attached to the surface of a suitable star, installing an alpha core and 10,000 units each of heavy machinery and supplies will begin the construction process.",,,
station_hypershunt,CUSTOM,The core systems of a coronal hypershunt. A powerful magfield deflects solar wind and keeps the structure anchored to a specific position above the star.,,,
