perfectclimate,Climate Sculpting Project,120,90,,12,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/climatesculpting.png,kentington.diyplanets.PerfectClimate,"In the Domain's golden age, a handful of terraforming specialists were capable of the ultimate artistry: perfectly adjusting a planet's climate to meet both the biological and aesthetic needs of humanity. These masters may be long-gone, but their brainprints were copied into specialized AI cores. If one could be found, it might still hold the potential to transform a terran world into a true paradise.
