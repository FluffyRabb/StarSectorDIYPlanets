Atmospheric Mineralizer,atmo_mineralizer,,,250000,1000,1,graphics/icons/cargo/planetkiller.png,ui_nano_pickup,ui_pristine_nano_drop,kentington.diyplanets.TerraformSpecialItemPlugin,,"A powerful and specialized terraforming package, containing a nanoforge loaded with firmware designed for atmospheric manipulation. Provided with the necessary raw materials and human assistance, it is capable of flooding a planet's atmosphere with nanoscale particles of various catalysts. Toxic or otherwise undesirable substances are precipitated out as an inert 'snow,' leaving a thinner and more human-compatible atmosphere.",420
Atmospheric Sublimator,atmo_sublimator,,,250000,1000,1,graphics/icons/cargo/volatiles.png,ui_nano_pickup,ui_pristine_nano_drop,kentington.diyplanets.TerraformSpecialItemPlugin,,"A powerful and specialized terraforming package, containing a nanoforge loaded with firmware designed for atmospheric manipulation. Provided with the necessary raw materials and human assistance, it is capable of flooding a planet's surface with nanoscale particles of various catalysts. Oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen are transmuted into their gaseous forms, eventually resulting in the formation of a terran-compatible atmosphere.

Its operation can also be reversed, removing a normal or thin atmosphere - although built-in failsafes prevent this operation on habitable worlds.",421
Stellar Reflector Core,solar_reflector,,,250000,1000,1,graphics/icons/cargo/nanoforge_decayed.png,ui_nano_pickup,ui_pristine_nano_drop,kentington.diyplanets.TerraformSpecialItemPlugin,,"A powerful and specialized terraforming package, containing a nanoforge loaded with firmware designed to produce vast sheets of reflective material. Provided with the necessary raw materials and human assistance, it is capable of drastically altering the amount of light that reaches a planet's surface. These enormous orbital mirrors can be just as easily used to shade a planet as to increase its illumination.",422
Tectonic Attenuator,tectonic_attenuator,,,250000,1000,1,graphics/icons/cargo/fighter_lpc2.png,ui_nano_pickup,ui_pristine_nano_drop,kentington.diyplanets.TerraformSpecialItemPlugin,,"A powerful and specialized terraforming package, containing a nanoforge loaded with firmware designed for tectonic manipulation. Provided with the necessary raw materials and human assistance, it is capable of flooding a planet's mantle with nanoscale webs of high-temperature elastopolymer. These filaments capture and disperse any large-scale magma flows, preventing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.",423
Weather Manipulation Core,weather_core,,,250000,1000,1,graphics/icons/cargo/biospecimens.png,ui_nano_pickup,ui_pristine_nano_drop,kentington.diyplanets.TerraformSpecialItemPlugin,,"A powerful and specialized terraforming package, containing a nanoforge loaded with firmware designed for atmospheric manipulation. Provided with the necessary raw materials and human assistance, it is capable of flooding a planet's upper atmosphere with dielectric nanoparticles. When charged by lightning, these particles repel one another, tearing apart storm cells before they reach dangerous sizes.",424
Terraformer Brainprint,climate_sculptor,,,500000,1000,1,graphics/icons/cargo/necrocore.png,ui_nano_pickup,ui_pristine_nano_drop,kentington.diyplanets.TerraformSpecialItemPlugin,,"A specialized AI core containing a complete human brainprint. This specimen belonged to one of the Domain's leading terraformers, a true artist in the field of climate manipulation. Provided with the necessary infrastructure, it could be used to perfect the environment of a habitable world.",425
N-Brane Oscillator Core,gravity_oscillator,,,500000,1000,1,graphics/icons/cargo/blueprintschip.png,ui_nano_pickup,ui_pristine_nano_drop,kentington.diyplanets.TerraformSpecialItemPlugin,,"A nearly mythic piece of Domain-era technology. When supported by the proper infrastructure, it is capable of permanently altering a planet's gravitational field.

Given the current state of physics research in the Sector, no one can say with confidence how it actually works, but it is theorized to somehow alter the fraction of gravitons which couple with three-dimensional space and the fraction which 'escape' into higher dimensions.",426
Irradicator Core,rad_remover,,,500000,1000,1,graphics/icons/cargo/chip1.png,ui_nano_pickup,ui_pristine_nano_drop,kentington.diyplanets.TerraformSpecialItemPlugin,,"A nearly mythic piece of Domain-era technology. When supported by the proper infrastructure, it is capable of tremendously accelerating the decay of specific radioisotopes across a planet’s surface – rapidly cleansing an irradiated world, or eliminating transplutonic deposits from a habitable one.

Given the current state of physics research in the Sector, no one can say with confidence how it actually works. Certain classes of planet-killer weapons are believed to work on similar principles by targeting radioisotopes in a planet’s core.",427
